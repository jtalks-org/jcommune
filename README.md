####State of Project

- Questions'n'Answers plugins is under development
- First the project was connected to Poulpe a lot - everything was administrated via admin panel. Now we think that Poulpe
should manage only Users and Groups and thus the project is in transition from "configuration in Poulpe" state to
"configuration in JCommune itself" state.
