#Configuration for ApplicationContextTest class
#This datasource.propertes file is same with datasource.properties file from jcommune-model artifact
#The essential problem here, that we have to override this file from sources component,
#We've tried to pack jcommune-model test components in jar , and to pluginConfiguration in jcommune-web-view
#but this case hasn't brought desirable result.
#For resolving this problem we have been forced to add the same datasource.propertes file in test/resources.

#Properties that can be overriden by env vars or by Tomcat JNDI variables are following BIG_LETTERS_CONVENTIONS
#Other properties that can be read only from this properties file are using such.usual_convention
